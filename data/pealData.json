        "A bad start to the term! Having come last in the striking competition, we then proceeded to ring a raggerd quarter. Rung one week late for St George's Day, having finished all our exams. The Conductor had six exams in five days, ending with a nasty Commodity Markets paper which he thinks he has failed. 4 had a Calculus exam this morning which had complex numbers in it which 4 couldn't do. Treble went to a party before ringing, while the rest continplated ringing a quarter of minimus on the front four, but fiddled with the Twiddle Pins on the seventh instead. 5 keeps asking what day it is and 2 has repeatedly said: \"we are all very tired\". We got this after the thrid attempt which is probably a new record for us. About the only successful ringing we've had this evening was the 480 of Little Bob we glided through during the first attempt, however,switching to St Clements proved to be a bad idea as we fired out after the first lead. It all started in 1964........"
