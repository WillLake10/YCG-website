<h2>Outing to Swaledale on 17th May
2003</h2>

<P align=center><I>At Aysgarth Falls. Unsurprisingly (as it's Yorkshire), it was
raining.<BR>

<P>8-50 on a Saturday morning is not a time generally known to students, but on
17th May twelve of us were waiting at the appointed meeting place in York city
centre at the appointed time (well - more or less!). The hired minibus was duly
collected, and we all piled into it and headed for Richmond, the first tower,
accompanied by confidence-inspiring creaks and groans from our vehicle, which
was driven by Adam Greenley.</P>

<P>After some difficulty in finding the correct church in Richmond, we arrived
there and rang on the only eight of the day, tenor 11 cwt. The anoraks of the
party duly noted the old inscribed tenor headstock and some inscribed pieces of
frame mounted on the ringing chamber walls. It was discovered that the 7th had a
tendency to slip wheel when Rob Lee or I rang it, although it didn't seem to
want to do it to anyone else. The suggestion was made that it could possibly be
attributed to sloppy handling, which is obviously hard to believe!</P>

<P>Following a brief stop at Richmond market for sustenance, we headed for the
pretty village of Grinton. No trouble finding the church here. The 10 cwt six
are rung from a large upstairs ringing chamber, which was used for the filming
of an episode of All Creatures Great and Small. Having rung, we went across the
road to the pub for lunch and a pint (or two, or three..). Then back into the
minibus and along the narrow winding lanes across the top of the dale towards
the next scheduled tower, Askrigg. However, Askrigg was not to be as a mile or
so from our destination the minibus ran out of diesel. Adam had realised that we
were low but thought we had enough to get to the next petrol station as the
warning light hadn't come on. It was knackered, evidently!</P>


<P align=center><IMG height=317 ALT="No, it's definitely not going to start!"

<P align=left>And so we found ourselves in the middle of
nowhere, blocking the road at the bottom of a hill with a minibus which wouldn't
go. While Adam steered, the other eleven of us pushed it backwards up the hill
to get it onto a verge out of the way. Have you ever tried pushing a 17-seater
minibus us a hill? I don't advise it! Having got it off the road, we asked a
couple who had been walking their dog and had just got back to their car nearby
how long it would take to walk to Askrigg. Twenty Minutes, apparently, but the
nearest petrol station was in Hawes five miles away. However, we were
unbelievably fortunate in that they had a can of diesel in the boot of their
car, and kindly sold it to us.</P>

<P>Mobile again, we abandoned any idea of ringing at Askrigg and headed into
Hawes to get more diesel. We then went on to the next tower, Aysgarth. The 12
cwt six were the heaviest bells of the day, hung on plain bearings. They went
well though, and we had some of the best ringing of the day here. A quick look
at the Aysgarth Falls (in the rain!) then on to the final tower, East Witton,
where we came across the Bishopthorpe ringers who were also on an outing in the
area. They'd got the classic Taylor eight at Middleham and we couldn't have them
- how dare they! Anyway, we had a ring on the six at East Witton, tenor 7 cwt,
where the 5th had a tendency to disappear at backstroke and some of the ropes
were so long that ringing while kneeling or sitting on the floor proved easiest
for some.</P>

<P>We then headed back to York (without running out of diesel this time!) and
returned the minibus. Later, most of us met up again at the university and some
people even got very drunk, hard though that will be to believe. One female
ringer, who shall of course remain nameless, seemed intent on chatting up every
bloke in Goodricke Bar, to the amusement of many onlookers.</P>

<P>Last but definitely not least, thanks to Mike for organising the day, to Adam
for driving the minibus along narrow winding lanes and to the towers we visited
for the use of their bells.</P>
