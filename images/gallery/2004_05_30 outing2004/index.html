<h2>Outing to the Ripon area - 30th May 2004</h2>

<p align="justify">This year's annual outing was to the Ripon area. We assembled bright and 
early (well - 9-00 and with no obvious hangovers) in one of the university's car 
parks. Mike Esbester had fetched the minibus and met us there. This year it was 
a shiny new one, and had plenty of diesel in its tank. Learning from last year's 
mistakes, evidently...</p>
<p align="justify">We were also met by David Potter in his car, and the two vehicles then headed 
to Aldborough, the first tower of the day. Arriving half an hour early, the more 
energetic played frisbee on the village green while the not-so-energetic 
watched. The lovely village, with its green and maypole, attracted 
favourable comment.

<p align="justify">We arrived at the pretty church at the allotted time, and everybody had 
chance to ring although some of the less experienced found the relatively long 
draught a little disconcerting. The creaking floor-board under the 5th and tenor 
was commented on, and an information panel nearby revealed why there were boards here in the 
otherwise stone floor: the pendulum of the clock comes down from above in a 
wooden case against the wall and goes into a six-foot-deep pit in the ground. It 
is the longest clock pendulum in the country, apparently. Somewhat surprisingly, 
the innuendo opportunities which a long pendulum offered were entirely missed, 
even by Emma and Maff.</p>

<p align="justify">Most of the ringers then headed for the next tower, while I had a look at the 
Aldborough bells and David Potter waited (anyone want to see my photos of the 
bells? No, I thought not...). We then joined the others at Kirby Hill, where it 
was slightly difficult fitting us all into the small upstairs ringing chamber. 
These are really good bells from the ringer's point of view - they go very well, 
have a short draught, and sound very clear and distinct in the ringing chamber. 
I noticed that a couple of ex-Huntington ropes which we donated on a York outing 
a couple of years ago were still in use. Members of the church were setting up 
for a church open day and were very friendly, offering us a cup of tea before we 
left. Time was short though, so reluctantly we had to decline.</p>
<p align="justify">Onwards, and to the only eight of the day at Sharow just outside 
Ripon, where Graham Blackburn joined us for ringing. The climb to the ringing 
chamber on the second floor caused some grumbles, and the tonal properties of 
the bells were debated at some length by myself and Graham. The bells go reasonably 
well, but feel a lot heavier than they actually are.</p>
<p align="justify">There was then much discussion about where to go for lunch, and we walked 
through the back streets of the village to the local pub, only to find that it 
was closed! More discussion took place as we retraced our steps, and fortunately 
Kevin comes from the area we were heading for and recommended the Green Dragon 
at Exelby. A phone call confirmed that they could accommodate us, and we duly 
headed there. The food was excellent - definitely a pub worth visiting again.</p>
<p align="justify">Then on to Burneston. The church was the finest of the day, an impressive 
largely Perpendicular structure. The bells have something of a reputation 
throughout Yorkshire, but I have to say that they didn't go anywhere near as 
badly as I had been led to believe. Their sound is, shall we say, unusual: they 
are quite noticeably out-of-tune! The learners managed surprisingly well on what 
was in some cases their first experience of plain bearings.</p>
<p align="justify">David Potter then left due to another engagement, and the 
rest of the group headed for the last tower, Kirby Wiske. I had high hopes of these having 
ascertained beforehand that apart from two old bells (4th and tenor) they are a 
complete Taylor job of 1930. I was not disappointed: they are really nice and 
were the best bells of the day. The long draught and light trebles proved a 
little off-putting for some, but 
they learned to cope. Unfortunately some of the ringing was of the 
end-of-the day type! Group photos were taken here, and after we had finished 
ringing we headed back to York.</p>
<p align="justify">Thanks to Helen Jonas (who couldn't come due to other commitments) and Nicci 
for organising the outing, Mike for arranging the hire of and driving the 
minibus, and the ringers at the towers we visited for the use of their bells.</p>
