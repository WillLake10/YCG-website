                                <p class="historyHeaders">Background of the fitting of the bells</p>
                                <p>The present church of St Lawrence, standing just outside the city walls, was built in
                                    1881-3 to the designs of J.G. Hall of Canterbury. The church is the largest parish
                                    church in York. It consists of nave with clerestory, aisles and transepts, an apsidal
                                    chancel, and a north-western tower with spire. The tower and spire were not built until
                                    1892-3. A peal of eight bells were installed during 1999.</p>

                                <p>Before the ring of bells was installed a vast amount of work had to be undertaken so that
                                    the tower could accommodate them. Two new floors, copying the design of the tower's
                                    original first level floor were installed, and an opening sound control floor was also
                                    installed between the bell chamber and louvre openings. The staircase access was also
                                    modified and the entire tower was rewired.</p>

                                <p>The ring of eight were cast with flat tops and have fittings by Taylor's 1999, comprising
                                    cast iron headstocks (tenor curved, remainder straight) with bolted gudgeons, ball
                                    bearings, traditional wheels, stays and sliders.</p>
                                <p class="historyHeaders">The Dumb Bell</p>
                                <p>The dumb bell (which weighs approximately 4 cwt) consists of a second-hand traditional
                                    wheel, to which is attached a large steel plate which covers up the majority of the
                                    wheel. To this plate is welded a socket containing a Hastings stay, with the
                                    corresponding radius slide being located beneath the dumb bell. The gudgeons are
                                    attached through the plate, and swing in light-duty ball bearings. There are weights
                                    bolted to the bottom of the plate, on the opposite side to the stay, and there are holes
                                    at various other points on the plate so that extra weights can be attached to certain
                                    places to alter the behaviour of the dumb bell, particularly its speed of swing. The
                                    dumb bell was designed by David Potter and Graham Blackburn, and is an improved version
                                    of the dumb bell at St Wilfrid. The St Lawrence dumb bell was designed to have a slow
                                    handstroke to aid the teaching of the transfer from handstroke to backstroke, which many
                                    learners find difficult, and in this aim it succeeds admirably.</p>
                                <p class="historyHeaders">The Frame</p>
                                <p>The ring of eight and the dumb bell hang in a frame designed in 1998 by Peter Hayward and
                                    built in 1998-9 by Graham Blackburn. The bellframe is of the lowside type, and is
                                    fabricated using channel, flat, angle and bar section steel, all galvanised and mounted
                                    on a grillage of RSJs.</p>
                                <p class="historyHeaders">The Clock</p>
                                <p>The clock bell is maiden and has angular canons. Its inscription notwithstanding, it is
                                    clearly the work of Warner's. It is hung 'dead' in the chamber above the ringing bells,
                                    being attached to a beam which spans the tower on the southern side, and has not been
                                    turned to present new faces to the blows of its hammers. The fittings comprise an
                                    internal wrought iron clapper hanging from a cast-in staple, although from the fact that
                                    no clapper scars are visible it would appear that this has never been used, an Ellacombe
                                    hammer and a clock hammer.</p>
                                <div class="imgTextWrapRight figBox">

                                </div>
                                <p>The clock, built by Potts of Leeds in the same year as its bell was cast, is located in
                                    the same chamber as the bell. It was reconstructed by R. Newey of York in 1948, and was
                                    restored and converted to electric winding in late 2000 / early 2001 by The Cumbria
                                    Clock Company. At the time of the installation of the ringing bells the same company
                                    quoted for the provision of five clock hammers and an electronic control unit to sound
                                    the Westminster quarters and the hour, but in the event this part of the scheme was not
                                    implemented.</p>
                                <p class="historyHeaders">Disused Bell</p>
                                <p>The disused 1739 bell, which is by Edward Seller II of York, is mounted on the wall of
                                    the ringing room. It has chamfered canons, and has not been turned. It is fitted with a
                                    timber headstock with nailed ironwork and drive-in gudgeons, and retains what appears to
                                    be its original clapper (with bun ball), hanging from the cast-in staple. Apart from the
                                    clapper, the fittings appear to be of late nineteenth or early twentieth century date.
                                    The bell formerly hung in the tower of the old church. When the ring of eight was
                                    installed Taylor's quoted for hanging it 'dead' in the tower of the present church with
                                    a trigger-action clapper, but in the event this was not carried out.</p>

                                <p class="historyHeaders">Bells of St Lawrence in and after the Civil War</p>
                                <p>The old church had a ring of three bells at the time of the Civil War, but the church and
                                    its tower were badly damaged by cannon ball fire during the 1644 siege of York and in
                                    1657 the City Council ordered that the bells of St Lawrence should be weighed and
                                    secured by Alderman Topham and Edmund Giles as the tower of the church was in danger of
                                    collapse. The City Corporation would assume responsibility for their safe-keeping. The
                                    bells were subsequently used as a supply of scrap for other churches in the city: the
                                    metal from the tenor, which weighed 4-0-7 and was cracked, was used in 1657 when two new
                                    bells were cast for the Minster (q.v.). The metal from the two smaller bells was used in
                                    1659 in casting a treble to augment the ring at Holy Trinity, King's Square (q.v.), to
                                    four. The task of repairing St Lawrence did not begin until 1669.</p>
                                <p class="historyHeaders">Proposals to add Bells back into St Lawrence</p>
                                <p>In 1944 there was a proposal (for which a faculty dated 22nd August 1944 was granted) to
                                    hang the back three bells from the redundant church of St John, Ouse Bridge (q.v.), in
                                    an oak frame in the tower of St Laurence. However, in the event this did not go ahead
                                    and all six bells were rehung at St John's in 1955 as part of the conversion of the
                                    building into The York Institute of Architectural Study.</p>
                                <p>In October 1997 The York Bell Fund put a proposal to install a ring of bells before the
                                    St Lawrence's PCC. The PCC agreed to this proposal on condition that they did not have
                                    to finance the scheme. The ringers agreed to this, and the tower was subsequently
                                    surveyed by Adrian Dempster, a member of the Towers and Belfries Committee of the
                                    Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, who advised that it could hold a ring of eight
                                    bells with a tenor of up to 10 cwt.</p>

                                <p class="historyHeaders">Procuring the New Ring</p>
                                <p>Five bells to form the basis of the ring (the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, and tenor) were already
                                    in the possession of The York Bell Fund. These, along with £5,000, were given
                                    immediately by The Fund. One of the bells (the 6th) had been part of a duplicate set of
                                    bells cast for the Albany City Hall Carillon in the USA, but had not been used there and
                                    had subsequently been purchased from the founders (Taylor's) in 1989. The bell was tuned
                                    by Taylor's to make it accord with the other four bells acquired for the ring. These
                                    bells had formerly been the four largest of a five-bell Westminster clock chime, cast by
                                    Taylor's in 1947 for G and F Cope, Clockmakers. The bells had been exhibited at the
                                    Olympia Exhibition, held in London in 1947, and had subsequently been sold and installed
                                    in Charrington's Brewery in the east end of London.</p>
                                <p>All five of the Charrington bells were subsequently sold back to Taylor's and later
                                    acquired by The York Bell Fund. The smallest bell was cast to a chiming scale, and was
                                    therefore too small and light to form part of a ring with the other four. It was sold
                                    for use as a single chiming bell, and is now at the church of St Augustine, Harehills,
                                    Leeds, where it is hung 'dead' in a frame affixed to the tower-cum-chimney-stack and is
                                    fitted with a lever clapper. </p>
                                <p>It is interesting to note that the four Charringtons bells were originally intended to
                                    form the basis of a ring of six for All Saints, North Street, and the current back four
                                    at North Street were intended as the back four of a six for All Saints, Pavement. They
                                    were given to North Street when the Pavement scheme fell through, and the bells intended
                                    for North Street were subsequently given to St Lawrence.</p>

                                <p>It was suggested that the Warner clock bell at St Lawrence could be recast as the 5th of
                                    the intended ring of eight. The Diocesan Bells Adviser agreed to this provided the
                                    inscription on the new bell recorded that it had been cast from the 1893 bell, but in
                                    the event there were objections from within the church community and the clock bell was
                                    retained. The five Taylor bells were augmented to eight by the addition of new treble,
                                    2nd and 5th bells, cast at Taylor's early in 1999. As five of the bells were old, it was
                                    decided to inscribe all eight by incision, and each bell now bears the dedication of a
                                    church or religious house which once stood within the present-day parish of St
                                    Lawrence. </p>
                                <p>The eight bells and their fittings were delivered on 29th March 1999 and placed on
                                    display in the church. They were christened on Easter Sunday and their hanging commenced
                                    on 10th April. The hanging was completed and the bells ready for the try-out by 29th
                                    April. They were dedicated by the Dean of York, The Very Reverend Raymond Furnell, on
                                    4th July 1999.</p>
